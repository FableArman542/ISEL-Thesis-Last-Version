I want to thank my supervisor, Artur Ferreira, for guiding me and supporting me through this project. I’m also grateful to the guidance team—Ana Ribeiro, Miriam Azevedo, and Rui Carvalho. Their help and encouragement made a big difference.

A special thanks to Alexandra Martis, Ana Cardoso, and Salomé Alves, for their availability to provide conditions for testing the games at Escola Básica da Portela, Lisbon.

A huge thank you to my mom for always being there and pushing me to keep going. And to my girlfriend, Eliana, thank you for all the motivation and support. You helped a lot with the research and design and stuck with me every step of the way. I couldn’t have done it without you.
