I want to thank my teacher, Artur Ferreira, for guiding me and supporting me through this project. I’m also grateful to the orienting team—Ana Ribeiro, Miriam Azevedo, and Rui Carvalho. Their help and encouragement made a big difference.

A huge thank you to my mom for always being there and pushing me to keep going. And to my girlfriend, Eliana, thank you for all the motivation and support. You helped a lot with the research and design and stuck with me every step of the way. I couldn’t have done it without you.
